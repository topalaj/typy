# ty.py - a typing game in the terminal

I was inspired by [typeracer](https://play.typeracer.com/).

## Requirements

python

python module [getkey](https://pypi.org/project/getkey/).

## Usage

Start the game
```
python ./ty.py
```
Enter how many Sentences you want to type.

## Notes

-This game does not work on windows.

-The game reads the sentences from a file called `sentences`. So you can add your own sentences in your desired language.
